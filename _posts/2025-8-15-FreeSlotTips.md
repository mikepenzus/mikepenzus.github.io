## Post-install tips
After you have installed FreeSlots, a menu called "FreeSlots" will appear in the menu bar.
If you open this menu, you can:
* Ask for the first 1-hour free slots in the next 7/14/21/28 days (incl. the current day)
  or
* Request the free slots with a specific duration (in minutes), day duration (eg, 9 AM to 5 PM), how many days.

The add-on doesn't include Saturdays and Sundays.
